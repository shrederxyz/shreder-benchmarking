# Shreder x Geyser Benchmark

Shreder is the fastest way to get block updates and receive transaction data on Solana.
It allows you to receive streaming data with Solana network transactions in real-time (0 block).

At its core, Shreder is a shred streaming service.
We bypass Solanaâ€™s standard mechanisms (like Turbine) and stream raw transaction data directly to your app.  Solana nodes (RPC or Validator) are not required.
This is the fastest possible way to receive real-time block data.

## Description

This repository helps you to benchmark your Geyser gRPC service against Shreder by evaluating incoming transaction timestamps.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for building the project

### Usage
1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shrederxyz/shreder-benchmark.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    In root of the project run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure the project**

    Copy .env-example to .env file and fill following variables:
    ```sh
    GEYSER_HOST_URL # you geyser provider host url
    GEYSER_API_KEY # you geyser provider api key
    SHREDER_HOST_URL # Shreder host url provided by the Shreder team 
    BENCHMARK_TIME # time of benchmarking
    ```

4. **Run script**

    To run benchmark:
    ```bush
    npm run start
    ```
    You will get result in the following format:
    ``` sh
    Avg Time diff: 120 # in ms. How Shreder faster than your geyser provider
    ```
